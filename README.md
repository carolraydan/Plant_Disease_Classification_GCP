## Dataset
Dataset : "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease/data"
Plant: "Potato"

## Notes
- This Projects goal is simply to show the ability to upload and moniter a GCP container with the pretrained model and call it using its generated link and get accurate results whilst having an interactive UI to navigate the results. 
- I have used Package manager "Poetry" listed inside files : package.json and for more detailed package details refer to : package-lock.json they have been turned into requirements.txt files for the sake of the streamlit App.
